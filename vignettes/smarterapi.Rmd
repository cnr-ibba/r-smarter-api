**smarterapi** is an R package which enable to browse the
[SMARTER backend API](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/) and
collect smarter data. In this R package, functions to deal with the different
API endpoints are implemented.

## Getting started

Simply import `smarterapi` like any other R package:

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(smarterapi)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# required by this vignette
library(pander)
```

## Collect info about versions

The smarter database is continuously updated, for example when receiving new
samples, genotypes, metadata or when something is fixed or updated, for example
when a new assembly is added. In order to ensure reproducibility and monitoring
changes, genotypes and metadata are provided using *versions*: this means that
you have to ensure that the genotypes dataset and metadata are referring to the
same version. You can check database version using the `get_smarter_info()`
method:

```{r}
info <- get_smarter_info()
info$version
info$last_updated
```

The same version system is specified in the genotype file dataset you can download
from the smarter FTP site:

```bash
$ tree -L 2 SHEEP/
SHEEP/
└── OAR3
    ├── archive
    ├── SMARTER-OA-OAR3-top-0.4.10.md5
    └── SMARTER-OA-OAR3-top-0.4.10.zip
```

You have to ensure that you are working with the same version, for both metadata
and genotypes: if not, you may not find samples in the genotype files or you are
referring to an out-dated assembly version. To see the changelist in each
version, please refer to the SMARTER-database
[HISTORY.rst](https://github.com/cnr-ibba/SMARTER-database/blob/master/HISTORY.rst)
file.

## Querying SMARTER API

The `smarterapi` package is structured to handle *requests/responses* to the
SMARTER API backend using R packages like `httr` and `jsonlite`.
In general, each functions accepts
a `query=list()` parameter, in which pass additional parameter to the API endpoint
in order to filter results matching query. Some functions like `get_smarter_samples()`
or `get_smarter_variants()` requires additional parameters like the `species` or
the `assembly` version. Each function in general will return results in a
`data.frame`: you could filter out data using `dplyr` or with standard R methods
or you could filter data *directly* by submitting a proper query to the API.
Please refer to the proper documentation to understand
which parameters a function expect. See also the
[SMARTER-backend API](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/) web
interface to have an idea on which parameter are allowed for each endpoint.

## Collect samples

Here are some examples on collecting samples. The main function required to collect
sample is `get_smarter_samples()`, which is an helper function which allow to query
the [/samples/goat](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Samples/get_samples_goat)
and [/samples/sheep](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Samples/get_samples_sheep)
endpoints of the SMARTER-backend API. We will use some other functions to have
better idea on which values to use to filter data. Remember that all the parameters
you see in each different example can be merged with other to restrict your query
to have only the samples you are looking for.

### Select by datasets

Getting samples by dataset is quite easy, you have to provide the proper `dataset_id`
to the `get_smarter_samples()` function. However, you have to determine the proper
`dataset_id` using the `get_smarter_dataset()` function, which model the
[/datasets](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Datasets/get_datasets)
endpoint. For example, to extract
only *background* genotypes datasets (data generated before SMARTER project) you
have to pass the proper `type` to the `query` argument. Since the `query` argument
is a list, you can pass multiple parameters at once. For parameters which supports
arrays, you could supply the same parameter name multiple times: 
each one will be passed through the API endpoint

```{r}
# select all genotypes datasets made before SMARTER project
background_genotypes <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(type = "background", type = "genotypes")
)

# same as before, but limiting to goat species
background_goat_genotypes <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(
    type = "background",
    type = "genotypes",
    species = "Goat"
  )
)
```

Take some time to explore the dataframe columns. There are two importants fields,
the first is the `_id.$oid` column, which is the `dataset_id` we want to provide
to collect samples belonging to this dataset.
The second is the `file` column, which is the archive name which was uploaded into
the smarter database. For example, here is what the `background_goat_genotypes`
table looks like:

```{r echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(background_goat_genotypes[, c("_id.$oid", "breed", "file")])
```

So collect the *adaptmap* samples, we can provide the proper `dataset_id` to the
`get_smarter_samples()` method. We can add additional parameters, like country:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# select the adaptmap id, which is in the first row of the dataframe
adatpmap_id <- background_goat_genotypes["_id.$oid"][1, 1]
adaptmap_goats <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Goat", query = list(dataset = adatpmap_id, country = "Italy")
)
```

The previous case is quite easy, we want only one dataset in
`background_goat_genotypes` dataframe, so we can simply paste this value in
the `get_smarter_samples` query. But how we can handle multiple datasets?
we can transform the proper column in a list and then renaming it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# get more datasets
foreground_goat_genotypes <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(type = "genotypes", type = "foreground", species = "Goat")
)

# construct the query arguments
datasets <- as.list(foreground_goat_genotypes$"_id.$oid")
names(datasets) <- rep("dataset", length(datasets))
breeds <- list(breed_code = "LNR", breed_code = "SKO", breed_code = "FSS")
query <- append(datasets, breeds)

# select samples: subset by breed code and datasets
foreground_goat_samples <- get_smarter_samples(species = "Goat", query = query)
```

We can also use the `get_smarter_datasets()` function to do a reverse selection
of our samples, for example to get all the samples which are not in one or more
datasets: suppose, for example, to collect all samples which are not in the
*isheep* datasets:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# collect all foreground datasets having "isheep" in their name
isheep_datasets <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(
    type = "foreground",
    type = "genotypes",
    search = "isheep"
  )
)

# collect ids for isheep datasets
isheep_ids <- isheep_datasets$"_id.$oid"

# collect all foreground samples
foreground_samples <- get_smarter_samples(
  "Sheep", query = list(type = "foreground")
)

# get rid of isheep_samples
filtered_samples <- foreground_samples %>%
  dplyr::filter(!`dataset_id.$oid` %in% isheep_ids)
```

The last selection example relies on dataset file contents: if you remember the
name of the file submitted in the dataset, you can search by datasets *content*:

```{r}
datasets <- get_smarter_datasets(query = list(search = "adaptmap"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(datasets[, c("_id.$oid", "breed", "file")])
```

This time two results are returned, since one is a *phenotypes* dataset, while
the other is a *genotypes*. To select only *genotypes*, simply add `type=genotypes`
to the `query` parameter.

### Select by breed

You can select samples relying on *breeds names* or *breed codes*. Breed names are
written in the languages they come from, so in order to retrieve *Île de France*
or *Fjällnäs* breed samples, you have to specify the full breed name or use the
search parameter with the `get_smarter_breeds()` which model the
[/breeds](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Breeds/get_breeds)
endpoint:

```{r}
breeds <- get_smarter_breeds(
  query = list(
    species = "Sheep",
    search = "de france"
  )
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(subset(breeds, select = c("name", "code")))
```

Search for breeds can return multiple values, for example:

```{r}
breeds <- get_smarter_breeds(
  query = list(
    species = "Sheep",
    search = "merino"
  )
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(subset(breeds, select = c("name", "code")))
```

Name and codes can be used as they are to select samples by passing multiple
arguments to the query:

```{r eval=FALSE}
selected_samples <- get_smarter_samples(species = "Sheep", query = list(
  breed_code = "MER", breed_code = "AME"
))
```

or to get all the samples with *merino* in breed name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# construct the query arguments
query <- as.list(breeds$code)
names(query) <- rep("breed_code", length(query))

# execute query
merino_samples <- get_smarter_samples(species = "Sheep", query = query)
```

### Select by country

You can retrive samples by countries. First get a list of the available
countries relying on country name, then extract samples using the correct
country name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
italy <- get_smarter_countries(query = list(search = "italy"))

italian_background_sheeps <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Sheep",
  query = list(
    country = italy$name[1]
  )
)
```

### Select by chip

You can select samples relying on the chip they are sequenced. If you search
for multiple chip types, you will collect all samples which belongs to any of
the specified chip. First, collect a list of the available chips for a certain
species:

```{r}
sheep_chips <- get_smarter_supportedchips(query = list(species = "Sheep"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(subset(sheep_chips, select = -c(`_id.$oid`)))
```

Then collect samples relying on chip name, for example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
selected_samples <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Sheep",
  query = list(
    chip_name = "IlluminaOvineHDSNP",
    chip_name = "AffymetrixAxiomOviCan"
  )
)
```

### Select by metadata

Since metadata aren't formatted in the same way in each samples, is difficult to
define a single query you can apply to each samples. For the moment, the only
queries you can apply on metadata are restricted to their presence or absence.
For example, we can collect all samples which have GPS coordinates and phenotypes
(any):

```{r eval=FALSE}
smarter_goats <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Goat",
  query = list(
    locations__exists = TRUE,
    phenotype__exists = TRUE
  )
)
```

After that, you have to filter out the `smarter_goats` dataframe in order to
collect only the samples you want.

## Refer samples to their original publication

Suppose you want to refer the samples to the original publication the come from:
in the *dataset* dataframe we have a `doi` column in which the *publication DOI*
is stored. You can use this information to collect publication information, but
you need to merge *samples* and *datasets* dataframes in order to refer properly
the samples to the publication they come from. Here is an example of how to do:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# collect all the genotypes datasets
datasets <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(
    species = "Sheep",
    type = "genotypes"
  )
)

# collect all the samples
samples <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Sheep",
)

# merge datasets and samples using dplyr
samples_with_doi <- dplyr::inner_join(
  datasets,
  samples,
  by = dplyr::join_by(`_id.$oid` == `dataset_id.$oid`)
) %>%
  dplyr::select(smarter_id, breed_code, breed.y, doi) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(doi))

# count how many samples come from each publication
samples_with_doi %>%
  group_by(doi) %>%
  summarise(counts = n())
```


## Collect genotypes

The *genotypes* can't be retrieved using the *smarter-api* because they are
available from the [public FTP](ftp://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter/). You need
to download the files using an FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
or [lftp](https://lftp.yar.ru/) and then
extract the genotypes using [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/).
In alternative, is it possible to download the genotypes using the `get_smarter_genotypes`
method of this package. This method will download the genotypes from the FTP 
for the current releases of the selected *species* and *assembly* and will
return the destination path of the downloaded archive:

```{r eval=FALSE}
downloaded_archive <- get_smarter_genotypes(
  "Sheep",
  "OAR3"
)
```

This method will download the genotypes in the current working directory, or 
in the directory specified in the `dest_path` argument. The genotypes will be stored
in a compressed `.zip` file, which need to be de-compressed in order to be
used with [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/).

## Subset genotypes relying samples

After you have identified the samples of your interest,
you can extract their genotypes from the proper file using
[plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/). First, you have to write a *TSV*
file with *breed_code* and *smarter_id* as columns. For example, using the samples
selected above and *dplyr*:

```{r eval=FALSE}
selected_sheeps_ids <- italian_background_sheeps %>%
  dplyr::select(
    "breed_code", "smarter_id"
  )

write.table(
  selected_sheeps_ids,
  file = "selected_sheeps.txt",
  quote = FALSE,
  sep = "\t",
  row.names = FALSE,
  col.names = FALSE
)
```

Next, you need to collect the proper *plink options* in order to not loose
information from the plink file. The parameters used to generate the genotype
files are tracked in the info endpoint. In this example, get parameters from
*Sheep* genotypes:

```{r}
info <- get_smarter_info()
plink_opts <- paste0(info$plink_specie_opt$Sheep, collapse = " ")
plink_opts
```

And finally you can call plink and providing your sample list:

```bash
plink --chr-set 26 no-xy no-mt --allow-no-sex \
  --bfile SMARTER-OA-OAR3-top-0.4.10 \
  --keep selected_sheeps.txt \
  --out selected_sheeps-OAR3-top-0.4.10 \
  --make-bed
```

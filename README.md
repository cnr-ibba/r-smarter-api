The goal of `smarterapi` is to collect data from [SMARTER REST
API](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/) and provide them
to the user as a dataframe. Get more information with the [online
vignette](https://cnr-ibba.github.io/r-smarter-api/articles/smarterapi.html).

## Installation

The `smarterapi` package is only available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and can be installed as a *source package*
or in alternative using
[devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package, for
example:

``` r
# install devtools if needed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cnr-ibba/r-smarter-api")
```

After the installation, you can load the package in your R session:

``` r
# import this library to deal with the SMARTER API
library(smarterapi)
```

## SMARTER credentials

After the public release of SMARTER data, thereâ€™s no need to provide
credentials to access the data. If you used to have credentials to
access the data, you need to install the latest version of `smarterapi`
package.

## Querying the SMARTER backend

`smarterapi` provides a set of functions used to fetch data from
*SMARTER-backend* endpoints described in [api
documentation](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/) and
returning them into a `data.frame` object. For example, the
`get_smarter_datasets` lets to query the [Datasets
endpoint](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Datasets/get_datasets),
while `get_smarter_samples` is able to query and parse the [Sample
endpoints](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Samples)
response. Each `smarterapi` function is documented in `R` and you can
get help on each function like any other R functions. There are two
types of parameters that are required to fetch data through the
*SMARTER-backend*: the `species` parameter, which can be `Goat` or
`Sheep` respectively for goat and sheep
[Samples](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Samples) or
[Variants](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/#/Variants)
endpoints, and the `query` parameter which can be provided to any
*get_smarter\_* function. The `species` parameter is *mandatory* in
order to query an endpoint specific for *Goat* or *Sheep*, while the
`query` parameter is optional and need to be specified as a `list()`
object in order to limit your query to some data in particular. For
example, if you need all the foreground genotypes datasets, you can
collect data like this:

``` r
datasets <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(type = "genotypes", type = "foreground"))
```

while if you require only background goat samples, you can do like this:

``` r
goat_samples <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Goat", query = list(type = "background"))
```

The full option list available to each endpoint is available on the
SMARTER-backend [swagger
documentation](https://webserver.ibba.cnr.it/smarter-api/docs/): the
option name to use is the same name described in *parameters*, and
description and parameter types can give you hints on how to exploit
endpoint properly. For instance, parameters described as *array of
objects* can be specified multiple times:

``` r
> goat_breeds <- get_smarter_breeds(query = list(species="Goat", search="land"))
> goat_breeds[c("name","code")]
            name code
1      Rangeland  RAN
2       Landrace  LNR
3         Landin  LND
4 Icelandic goat  ICL

> goat_samples <- get_smarter_samples(
    species = "Goat", 
    query = list(
      breed_code="RAN", 
      breed_code="LNR", 
      breed_code="LND", 
      breed_code="ICL"
    )
  )
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to collect data from SMARTER
REST API for the *Italian* goats belonging to the *Adaptmap* dataset:

``` r
# collect the dataset by providing part of the name with the search option:
# since we are forcing to collect only background genotypes, only one dataset
# will be returned
datasets <- get_smarter_datasets(
  query = list(
    species = "Goat", 
    search = "adaptmap", 
    type = "genotypes", 
    type = "background"
    )
)

# get the dataset id
adatpmap_id <- datasets["_id.$oid"][1]

# collect all the italian goats from the adaptmap dataset. Using the dataset id
# to filter out all the samples belonging to this dataset and the country option
# to filter out only the italian samples for this dataset
adaptmap_goats <- get_smarter_samples(
  species = "Goat", 
  query = list(
    dataset = adatpmap_id, 
    country = "Italy"
  )
)
```

We have other examples in the
[vignettes](https://cnr-ibba.github.io/r-smarter-api/articles/), for
example how to collect data from the
[Variants](https://cnr-ibba.github.io/r-smarter-api/articles/variants.html)
endpoints or how to work with [geographic
coordinates](https://cnr-ibba.github.io/r-smarter-api/articles/geojson.html).
